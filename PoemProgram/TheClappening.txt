The Clappening by Phillip Cuesta
A lone figure stands, without so much a name
Another figure lurches from behind
Ready to unleash the purest flame
The lone figure seems to respond in kind
Yet with no hint of shame
Plunges knee to one behind
Announcer bellows the word game
Thus ends the play of the mind
